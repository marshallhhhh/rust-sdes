# sDES in rust
I had just finished a university assignment on sDES and thought it might be fun to do a little bit of bit-twiddling and implement sDES myself. 

I didn't feel like picking up C again and had wanted to try out Rust for a little while, so I made this my first Rust project.

I'd also been thinking about WASM lately so I tried my hand at compiling the rust program to a WASM app and wrapped it all into a website which you can try on my github pages https://marshallhhhh.github.io/rust-sdes/
